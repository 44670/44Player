# Firmware

# Flashing the chip

If the chip is empty, it will automatically enter download mode when you connect it to the USB port. Otherwise, you may need to use the "force-download" tool.

To flash the firmware, you need to obtain `AC692x_SDK_release_V2.6.3` from a reseller of JieLi.

Once you've installed the SDK, copy `sdk.app` and flashme.bat files to `AC692x_SDK_release_V2.6.3\apps\download\post_build\flash` folder.

You can then flash the firmware by running `flashme.bat` as an **administrator**, while the device is connected to the computer."
